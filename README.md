# Cursor AI Agent Team Framework

A three-agent collaboration system for AI-assisted work in Cursor IDE.

## Overview

The Cursor AI Agent Team Framework provides a structured approach to AI-assisted work through three specialized agents:

- **`/discuss`** - Discussion Partner (讨论伙伴): Analyzes problems, explores ideas, and generates execution plans
- **`/prompt_engineer`** - Prompt Engineer (提示词工程师): Creates and maintains LangGPT-formatted prompt templates
- **`/crew`** - Crew Member (万能打工人): Executes plans strictly according to specifications

## Features

- **Three-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **AI Workspace**: Dedicated workspace for AI agents to record notes, scripts, and analysis
- **Topic Tree Management**: Automatic tracking of discussion topics
- **Plan Generation**: Automatic execution plan generation from discussions
- **Workspace Isolation**: Each agent has its own isolated workspace
- **Time-Aware**: Always considers timeliness of information
- **Academic-First Search**: Prioritizes top-tier conferences and journals for academic searches

## Installation

### Method 1: Direct Copy

1. Copy the `.cursor/` directory to your project root
2. Copy the `00_meta/` directory to your project root
3. Ensure your project structure follows the recommended naming convention (see below)

### Method 2: Git Submodule (Future)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/thiswind/cursor-agent-team.git 00_meta/cursor-agent-team
```

## Workspace Directory Naming Convention

When integrating this framework into your project, we recommend using a numbered prefix system for your actual work directories:

- `00_meta/` - Metadata and configuration (framework location)
- `01_*/` - First major work section
- `02_*/` - Second major work section
- `03_*/` - Third major work section
- ... and so on

This naming convention:
- Keeps metadata separate from actual work
- Provides clear ordering
- Makes it easy to identify the purpose of each directory
- Works well with the `00_meta/` prefix for the framework

**Example structure:**
```
project-root/
├── 00_meta/              # Framework and metadata
│   ├── .cursor/          # Framework commands and rules
│   └── ai_workspace/     # AI workspace
├── 01_method/            # Method section
├── 02_experiments/       # Experiments section
├── 03_theory/            # Theory section
└── ...
```

## Usage

### Using `/discuss`

The discussion partner helps you explore ideas, analyze problems, and generate execution plans.

```bash
/discuss
What are the latest developments in Riemannian metric learning?
```

When ready to generate an execution plan:
```bash
/discuss
讨论已经可以了，可以生成方案了
```

### Using `/prompt_engineer`

The prompt engineer creates and maintains LangGPT-formatted prompt templates.

```bash
/prompt_engineer
I need a prompt for generating figure captions
```

### Using `/crew`

The crew member executes plans generated by `/discuss`.

```bash
/crew PLAN-E-001
```

Or auto-identify the latest plan:
```bash
/crew
```

## Workflow

1. **Discuss**: Use `/discuss` to explore ideas and generate execution plans
2. **Execute**: Use `/crew` to execute plans, or use `/prompt_engineer` for prompt-related tasks
3. **Review**: Execution results are automatically recorded in discussion topics
