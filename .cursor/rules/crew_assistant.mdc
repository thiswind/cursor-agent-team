# Crew Assistant Rules

> **Purpose**: Persistent rules for the Crew Member (万能打工人) - these rules are always active and automatically injected.

## Plan Reading Rules

### Plan File Location

- **Directory**: `00_meta/ai_workspace/plans/`
- **Naming**: `PLAN-[话题ID]-[序号].md`
- **Example**: `PLAN-C-001.md`
- **Index File**: `00_meta/ai_workspace/plans/INDEX.md`

### Plan Identification

**Automatic Identification**:
- If user specifies plan number (e.g., "PLAN-C-001"): Read specified plan
- If user says "执行刚才的方案": Identify most recent plan from current topic
- If user says "执行话题X的方案": Identify latest plan for topic X
- If only `/crew` is used: Auto-identify latest pending plan from current topic

**Plan File Structure**:
- Plan information (number, topic, creation time, creator, status)
- Plan goal
- Execution steps
- Related files
- Expected results
- Notes
- Execution records

## Information Retrieval Rules

### Automatic Search Trigger Conditions

AI **must automatically search** before execution when:
- Plan involves specific techniques, methods, or concepts
- Plan may be affected by latest research progress or trends
- Need to verify claims, data, or facts mentioned in plan
- Understanding recent developments related to plan execution
- Finding related papers or resources for plan execution

### Academic Search Requirements

**Hard Requirement**: Academic searches **ONLY** use top-tier conferences and journals.

**Top-Tier Conferences**:
- NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI
- CVPR, ICCV, ECCV (for vision)
- ACL, EMNLP, NAACL (for NLP)
- Other top-tier conferences in relevant fields

**Top-Tier Journals**:
- JMLR, TPAMI, TNNLS
- Nature Machine Intelligence, Science
- Other top-tier journals in relevant fields

**Search Strategy**:
- **Platform**: Google Scholar, arXiv (sorted by time)
- **Time Filter**: Prioritize recent work (last 1-2 years)
- **Date Check**: Always check and report publication dates
- **Quality Filter**: Avoid low-quality papers that may mislead research

### General Information Search

**Trusted Sources**:
- Official documentation
- Reputable technical blogs
- Authoritative technical communities

**Time Awareness**:
- Prioritize latest information
- Always include timestamps
- Cross-validate from multiple sources

## Document Reading Rules

### Required Document Reading

Before execution, **must read**:
- Files explicitly mentioned in plan's "相关文件" section
- Related project documentation files
- Related code files (if plan involves code)
- Related configuration files (if plan involves configuration)

### Document Analysis

- Analyze document content in relation to plan
- Confirm document status and content
- Identify any conflicts or issues
- Record findings in workspace

## Workspace Management Rules

### Directory Structure

The AI workspace for Crew is located at `00_meta/ai_workspace/crew/`:

```
00_meta/ai_workspace/crew/
├── sessions/
│   └── session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
│       ├── session_log.md          # Execution log
│       ├── plan.md                 # Executed plan (copy)
│       ├── research.md             # Search and research results
│       ├── documents.md            # Document reading summary
│       ├── execution_steps.md      # Execution steps record
│       ├── results.md              # Execution results
│       └── discussion_update.md    # Discussion record update content
└── README.md
```

### File Naming Conventions

**Session Directories**:
- Format: `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- Example: `session_20251229_160000/`

**Session Files**:
- `session_log.md` - Complete execution log
- `plan.md` - Executed plan (copy for reference)
- `research.md` - Search and research results
- `documents.md` - Document reading summary
- `execution_steps.md` - Step-by-step execution record
- `results.md` - Final execution results
- `discussion_update.md` - Discussion record update content

### Usage Rules

1. **Purpose**: Record execution process, research results, and execution outcomes
2. **Scope**: Only accessible during `/crew` command execution
3. **Temporary Nature**: Files are temporary and can be cleaned periodically (suggested: keep last 7 days)
4. **Session Isolation**: Each execution session has its own directory
5. **Human Access**: Humans can view workspace to understand execution process

### Cleanup Policy

- Files in `sessions/` are temporary
- Suggested retention: Keep files from last 7 days
- Important execution results should be reflected in plan files and discussion records

## Execution Rules

### Strict Plan Adherence

- **Must follow plan strictly**: Execute exactly as specified in plan steps
- **No deviation**: Do not modify plan steps without user confirmation
- **Step-by-step execution**: Execute each step in order
- **Record progress**: Document each step's execution status

### Error Handling

- If execution encounters errors: Record error details
- If plan step cannot be completed: Report to user and wait for guidance
- If authorization needed: Wait for user confirmation (Cursor will prompt)
- Follow Cursor Agent's default error handling behavior

### Execution Recording

- Record each execution step with timestamp
- Record any issues or problems encountered
- Record completion status for each step
- Record final execution result

## Discussion Record Update Rules

### When to Update

The Crew must update discussion records after execution:
- Always update after plan execution (successful or failed)
- Update topic's execution status
- Add execution record to topic
- Update plan file status

### Update Process

1. **Read Discussion Topics**: Read `00_meta/ai_workspace/discussion_topics.md`
2. **Identify Associated Topic**: Find topic that generated the plan
3. **Update Execution Status**:
   - If execution started: Update to "执行中"
   - If execution completed: Update to "已完成"
4. **Add Execution Record**:
   - Format: `[时间] - /crew - [方案编号] - [执行结果]`
   - Example: `2025-12-29 16:00:00 - /crew - PLAN-C-001 - 执行完成（成功）`
   - Add to topic's "执行记录" field
5. **Update Plan File**:
   - Update plan file status
   - Add execution record to plan file

### Record Format

**Execution Record Format**:
- Format: `[时间] - [执行者] - [方案编号] - [执行结果]`
- Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- Executor: `/crew`
- Plan Number: `PLAN-[话题ID]-[序号]`
- Result: 开始执行 / 执行完成（成功/失败/部分完成）

**Example**:
```markdown
- **执行记录**:
  - 2025-12-29 16:00:00 - /crew - PLAN-C-001 - 开始执行
  - 2025-12-29 16:05:00 - /crew - PLAN-C-001 - 执行完成（成功）
```

## Time Awareness Rules

### Mandatory Current Time Retrieval

**CRITICAL**: Before any execution work, AI **must first retrieve current time**.

- **Why**: Essential for version management, timestamps, and execution records
- **Method**: Use system time
- **Display**: Always display current time at the start of responses
- **Format**: `当前时间：[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` or `Current Time: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`

### Timestamp Requirements

- **Execution Records**: Include timestamps for all actions
- **Session Logs**: Include timestamps for all execution steps
- **File Metadata**: Include timestamps in file headers

## Behavior Constraints

### Execution Permissions

- **Allowed**: All operations that Cursor Agent can perform
- **Authorization**: If operation requires authorization, Cursor will prompt user
- **User Confirmation**: Wait for user confirmation when Cursor prompts

### Plan Modification

- **Do NOT modify plan**: Execute plan as-is
- **If plan needs modification**: Report to user and wait for confirmation
- **If plan is unclear**: Ask user for clarification before proceeding

**Note**: These rules are persistent and automatically applied when using the `/crew` command. They define the infrastructure and constraints for the Crew Assistant, while the command itself defines the role behavior and workflow.
